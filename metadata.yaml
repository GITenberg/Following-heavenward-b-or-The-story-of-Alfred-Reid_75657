summary: '"Following Heavenward: or, The Story of Alfred Reid" by Pansy is a novel
  written in the early 20th century. The book follows the journey of the main character,
  Alfred Reid, as he grapples with the legacy of his late sister, Esther Reid, who
  was a compassionate soul dedicated to helping the underprivileged. The narrative
  explores themes of duty, social responsibility, and the complexities of human relationships,
  particularly in the context of urban poverty.  The opening of the story introduces
  a rain-soaked city where Alfred Reid, a young clerk, reflects on the impactful life
  of his sister, expressing confusion and sorrow over how to help a group of troubled
  boys she had cared for. His internal struggle becomes apparent as he feels inadequate
  to continue her work. Concurrently, we are introduced to Mrs. Roberts, an elegantly
  dressed woman interested in Alfred’s sister''s life. They quickly engage in a conversation
  about the boys of whom Alfred speaks, revealing a shared desire to assist them.
  As Mrs. Roberts volunteers to take on the challenge of teaching a difficult children''s
  class, Alfred’s reservations about her capabilities highlight the tension between
  privilege and outreach, setting the stage for their eventual collaboration and the
  unfolding narrative of compassion and community involvement. (This is an automatically
  generated summary.)'
